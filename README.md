## Hi there 👋

<!--
**ming-x-yue/ming-x-yue** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
I’m a Software Engineering student at McGill University with a strong interest in backend development and applied AI systems. I enjoy building reliable, production-grade AI solutions that combine LLMs, retrieval systems, and backend engineering to solve real business problems.

Currently, I’m working as a Backend AI Developer Intern at Ciena, where I focus on improving the reliability and evaluation of multi-agent RAG systems used for enterprise documentation search.
