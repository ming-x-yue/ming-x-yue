## Hi there 👋 I'm Ming Xuan Yue

I’m a **Software Engineering student at McGill University** with a strong interest in **backend development and applied AI systems**.  
I enjoy building **reliable AI solutions** that combine **LLMs, RAG retrieval and backend engineering** to solve real business problems.

Currently, I’m working as a **Backend AI Developer Intern at Ciena**, where I focus on improving the reliability and evaluation of **multi-agent RAG systems** used for cloud emulation portal.
